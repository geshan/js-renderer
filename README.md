# js-renderer

A online puppeteer service to render pages with javascript (js). Mainly useful for web scraping (not using splash).

At times while scraping web pages you will come across websites or web pages that only render on a browser that renders the loaded javascript. If you curl it or use something like [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/), you just end up with not useful HTML.

This project aims to solve that issue with Puppeteer. With Scrapy you can use [Splash](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash) but it is Scrapy specific and not easy to configure.
